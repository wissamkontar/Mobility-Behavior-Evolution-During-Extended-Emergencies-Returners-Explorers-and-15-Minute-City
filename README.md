# Multi-Stage Clustering of Daily Human Activities: Patterns and Socio-Demographic Insights

This repository contains code and instructions for reproducing the analysis presented in the study **"Multi-Stage Clustering of Daily Human Activities: Patterns and Socio-Demographic Insights."** The project focuses on clustering human mobility patterns using large-scale mobile phone data and explores behavioral shifts across normal and emergency periods.

## ðŸ§ª Notebooks

The repository contains two main Jupyter notebooks for analysis:

- **`Normal_Period.ipynb`**  
  Performs clustering and visualization for the **normal time period**.

- **`Emergency_Period.ipynb`**  
  Performs similar analysis and visualizations for the **emergency period**.

Each notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing
- Clustering steps
- Plot generation for mobility patterns and behavioral insights
